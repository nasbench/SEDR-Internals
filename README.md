# SEDR-Internals

This is a place where I put everything related to my research on Symantec EDR Internals. Currently it contains the following:

* **[SEDR_Enrichment_Rules](https://github.com/nasbench/SEDR-Internals/blob/main/SEDR_Enrichment_Rules.txt)** : A list of Symantec EDR data enrichment rules with a short description for each.

* **[Symantec_Heuristics_Sig](https://github.com/nasbench/SEDR-Internals/blob/main/Symantec_Heuristics_Sig.txt)** : A list of Symantec EDR heuristics signatures with a description for each. Plus an inclusion of the corresponding "threat.id" value for usage with Symantec EDR (SEDR) search queries.

* **[Symantec_SONAR_Sig](https://github.com/nasbench/SEDR-Internals/blob/main/Symantec_SONAR_Sig.txt)** : A list of Symantec SONAR signatures with a description of each signature. Plus an inclusion of the corresponding "bash.virus_id" value for usage with Symantec EDR (SEDR) search queries.


I also wrote a couple of blog posts about the "SEDR ML Engine Criterion" and "SEDR Enrichment Rules" which you can find here:

* **[Symantec EDR Internals — Criterion](https://nasbench.medium.com/symantec-edr-internals-criterion-fa49be4e21af)**
* **[Symantec EDR Internals — Event Enrichment Rules (Part I)](https://nasbench.medium.com/symantec-edr-internals-event-enrichment-rules-part-i-b5e4340041a7)**
